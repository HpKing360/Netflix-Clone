# Netflix Clone built using React, Redux Toolkit, Firebase, Styled Components, Axios, Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

Design and develop a streaming platform resembling Netflix, leveraging React for the frontend interface
and Redux Toolkit for state management. The backend will be implemented using Node.js, MongoDB for
the database, and Firebase for user authentication and hosting and the TMDb API to fetch movie and TV
show data.

The goal is to create a user-friendly, responsive web application that allows users to browse, search, and
watch a catalog of movies and TV shows. Implemented features such as user authentication, a
database to store media content and user preferences, a responsive UI for seamless browsing across
devices, and a video player for streaming content. Ensure a secure and scalable architecture while
optimizing for performance to provide an experience akin to a streaming service like Netflix.
